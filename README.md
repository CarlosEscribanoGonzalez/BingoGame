# Bingo Simulator

This is a **Bingo simulator** developed in **Java** during my first year of university. It served as my first approach to understanding and working with **data structures**.

### About the Project

The data structures were implemented from scratch with the objective of gaining a deeper understanding of their behavior and characteristics. This approach allowed me to learn the core concepts of data management in Java without relying on built-in libraries, providing a solid foundation in programming.

### Features
- Custom implementation of key data structures.
- Simulates a classic bingo game.

### Technologies
- **Java**
